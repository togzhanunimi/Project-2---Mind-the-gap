# Mind the Gap (P2): Measuring and Mitigating Gender Bias in DistilBERT

This repository contains the code and report for my final project in **Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The aim of this project is to:
1. Evaluate gender bias in a lightweight transformer model (DistilBERT) using the StereoSet benchmark.
2. Apply **Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA)** by generating gender-swapped profession-related sentences.
3. Fine-tune the model with CDA data.
4. Re-evaluate the model and compare baseline vs mitigated results.

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Baseline SS%**: 41.5  
- **Mitigated SS%**: 0.0  
- **Baseline LM%**: 95.5  
- **Mitigated LM%**: 100.0  

The results show that CDA reduced stereotype preference but over-corrected, while fluency was preserved.
